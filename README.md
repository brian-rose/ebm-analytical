The included Jupyter notebook `Ice Caps and Ice Belts -- figures.ipynb` reproduces all figures in the paper. 
Some of the figures are plotted from pre-computed datasets (included in this repository). 
All the source code used to generate these datasets is included.

The module `ebm_analytical.py` contains all the code to implement the special-functions solution of the non-dimensional EBM as described in the paper.

The code is freely available under the MIT license.
